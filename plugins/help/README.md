# Help plugin

## Features

Get help for plugins right inside the terminal.

For example, type

    help-plugin help

to view this README.

It is advised to install a terminal Markdown viewer, such as
[mdless](https://github.com/ttscoff/mdless/) which takes precedence over
[mdv](https://github.com/axiros/terminal_markdown_viewer).
